# DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The task is to develop a console-based database management system (DBMS) using an object-oriented programming style. The program has the following functionality:

1. Data table creation: The user can enter the table name, number of columns, as well as their names and types. After creating the table, the user is shown the table header and prompted to populate it.

2. Data table browsing and editing: The user can select an existing table for viewing. After selecting a table, the user is shown its contents and provided with options for editing the data. The user can perform edits on specific rows and columns, delete rows, or add new data.

3. Report generation: The user can view reports available in the system. The report is displayed in the console, and the user is offered additional functionality such as sorting by column, filtering by value, and printing the report (saving to a file).

4. Program termination: The user can end the program.

### The project utilizes prettytable library for formatting data tables and SQLite.

### The program interface is implemented in a console-based format, enabling convenient interaction with the user.
